# SIMULATION OF MULTIRATE DSP WITHOUT FUNCTION
# EXP 6 : SPEECH RECOGNITION USING SCILAB

## AIM: 

To perform and verify multirate DSP without function using SCILAB.

## APPARATUS REQUIRED: 
PC installed with SCILAB. 

## PROGRAM : 

//  SPEECH RECOGNITION USING SCILAB

## OUTPUT: 


## RESULT: 
Thus the decimation process by a factor M and interpolation process by a factor L using 
SCILAB was implemented.
